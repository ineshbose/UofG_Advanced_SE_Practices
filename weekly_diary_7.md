## Diary Entry

<!-- Diary entries are marked on a pass/fail basis and are intended to help you build evidence for designing your PIA. If you make a reasonable attempt at the diary each week then you will receive the full mark for the diary. Use the diary to record your observations about the Level 3 Team Projects. Each diary entry should describe issues that you were asked to help with during the laboratory by your project team and the advice you gave to resolve the problem. Consider how the evidence from the diary entry might inform the design of your PIA, as well as any recommendations for changing the delivery of the course in light of the issue raised. -->

The second half of the warmup PIA was left which involved code reviews, therefore this week's online meeting format was more helpful (to share screen), however even though there wasn't any activity required from the team's end, it seemed not everyone was actively listening. Reviews were left on the required MRs, and then that wrapped the warmup PIA. Post that, the customer meeting and retrospectives were discussed. The team was mostly happy with their progress, and they seemed to have things planned and in order so far.
