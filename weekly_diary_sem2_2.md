## Diary Entry

<!-- Diary entries are marked on a pass/fail basis and are intended to help you build evidence for designing your PIA. If you make a reasonable attempt at the diary each week then you will receive the full mark for the diary. Use the diary to record your observations about the Level 3 Team Projects. Each diary entry should describe issues that you were asked to help with during the laboratory by your project team and the advice you gave to resolve the problem. Consider how the evidence from the diary entry might inform the design of your PIA, as well as any recommendations for changing the delivery of the course in light of the issue raised. -->

The team had met up with the customer and were happy with what they discussed so far. Their progress was appreciated, and have already put down their main tasks to focus on until the next meeting - connecting the server/database with the client, and implementing a UI for the client from scratch (as their previous method failed - due to using Python instead of JavaScript). Since I have also had experience in both areas, I strongly suggested solutions which hopefully they will take a look into and dive deeper.

Even though the team has been active with retrospectives, it seemed that the participation for this retrospective was underwhelming - maybe because they were happy with the customer meet and that as all they could think about, but also that maybe they had set the bar high for me in my mind. However, keeping that aside, this time the team was keen onto doing more of merge requests (helpful for code review) and implementing testing (helpful to have pipelines). So, for the team to also get this working soon, it might be great if the final PIA is about this and so eventually lot of results and effects can be seen.
