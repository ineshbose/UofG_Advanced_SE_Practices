##  Problem Identification

<!-- Describe the problem, issue or opportunity that you wish to address with the Project Team. Explain what you think the underlying cause of the issue is for the team and provide evidence that you have that the problem you have identified is real. You are required to conduct formative assessments of your team's software process: use this to help identify an issue. -->

Over the course, through the coach meetings and the warmup PIA, the team has grown to solve problems and use best practices. Because of this, it was difficult to find a critical flaw in their development strategy. They have seemed to research into solutions for their project and have made good progress - they are near the final stages; this may have been possible because of their approach of working in different areas of the project like the backend server, parsing, interface and frontend client. While this approach seems great on paper, I was worried for the team facing *"subsystem optimisation"* where the team members would only have knowledge of the area they were working on.

The confirmation of this suspicion was when a major issue (one that required lot of effort and time) ended up being scrapped [1, [Weekly Diary 2 (Semester 2)](https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/2504266b/asep-coursework-2021/-/blob/master/weekly_diary_sem2_3.md)] as the team did not coordinate about what areas would be relevant to the issue. Along with this, the obvious signal about this problem was when each member appears to be on a different frequency - talking about completely different topics (relevant to their areas) with no other member having any knowledge about the same. If any member was also missing in action, that area would have less progress compared to others. Therefore, **the solution would come by having code reviews** within the team that would require each member to understand changes in different areas of the project, along with **improving their merge requests quality** as they felt they could be improved [1, [Weekly Diary 2 (Semester 2)](https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/2504266b/asep-coursework-2021/-/blob/master/weekly_diary_sem2_3.md)].

The team, being self-aware, had also mentioned that they should have pipelines and testing setup at this point. For the sake of focusing on only code reviews to improve on, **testing would be discussed for merge requests** as that can be seen as the first step of a code review - tests passing.

## Description and Justification of PIA

<!-- Describe the PIA you will undertake with the team. Explain why you think the activity will address the issue you have identified. You can provide references to descriptions of standard practices rather than repeating them in detail. However, you should outline any customisations you intend to make to a practice. -->

Similar to the [warmup PIA [2]](https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/2504266b/asep-coursework-2021/-/blob/master/warmup.md), the PIA was sketched out and conducted on a [separate repository [3]](https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/2504266b/asep-final-pia-2021/) which would have a setup similar to theirs, but they would have to do minor feature implementations which are expected to take less than an hour if they follow the instructions and example given to them.

Once they have implemented their features (along with tests written for them), each merge request created by the members would be reviewed thoroughly to showcase the process of a code review. This was planned for the [warmup PIA [2]](https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/2504266b/asep-coursework-2021/-/blob/master/warmup.md) as well, but not the main focus.

## Monitoring and Evaluation

<!-- Describe how you will evaluate the PIA. State your objectives for the PIA. You should state any measurements that you will record, how and when you will record them and how you plan to evaluate them. Measurements may be quantitative (lines code, for example) or qualitative (discussions during a retrospective, for example). -->

## Implementation Report

<!-- Provide an overview of the implementation of the PIA, including the dates, times when activities took place and the teams which participated. Summarise problems or unexpected situations that arose during the implementation of the PIA.
Report any changes that were made to the implementation plan as a result of problems encountered during the implementation of the PIA. Give the reasons that the changes were made, including any supporting evidence (qualitative and/or quantitative) that justified the change. -->

### Results

<!-- Present a detailed breakdown of the data gathered during the PIA. You do not need to include the raw data gathered during the PIA, although you may include this in an appendix if you wish. Rather, you should summarise the key results identified in the data, such as trends in quantitative data, or important themes gathered from qualitative data, such as retrospectives (include extracts from discussions as appropriate). You can also use graphs to illustrate quantitative data. -->

## Critical Assessment

<!-- Develop A critical assessment of the success and/or failure of the PIA based on the data gathered during the exercise. You should present an honest assessment of the PIA, identifying both successes and failures as appropriate. Link the  discussion to evidence captured during the exercise. Relate the evidence to other literature that covers similar PIA
   activities, such as similar case studies, text book descriptions of the PIA that include risks and benefits and/or industry white papers. -->

## Future Process Improvement Activity

<!-- Make a recommendation for a future process improvement activity. This should be related to your insights gathered during this activity. For example, if you found that pair programming was ineffective, is their reason to believe an alternative collaborative activity, such as continuous code reviews, or mob programming would be more effective. Explain your reason for choosing an activity. -->
