# Formative Assessment 2

## Change Management

| Question|Awarded<br>(1-5)|
|:--|--|
|Did the team make small, frequent commits to the project SCM? Are all team members contributing to the SCM?|2|
| Did each commit have an informative log message that had a one sentence summary, explained the rationale for the change in more detail, with a reference to the relevant ticket in the issue management system?|3|
|Is the project SCM appropriately organised according to project/language conventions? Are there non-configuration items in the repository (e.g. binaries, compiled documentation)?|4|
|Does the team have established practices for managing concurrent development and conflict resolution, such as feature branching?|1|
|Other/discretion||

### Comment
The team admitted to not making frequent commits/pushes to the remote and local repository. During on-campus weekly meets, there would be plenty on unstaged changes while they would be in flow with research, learning and testing a technology. The team should be aware of the organisation practices after emphasising on the same multiple times.

## Project Planning

| Question|Awarded<br>(1-5)|
|:--|--|
|Are the details of ticket (ownership, milestones, issue type, priority etc.) complete in the issue management system? Are there milestones for each iteration of the project with associated tickets?	|3|
|Are tickets frequently updated during the course of the iteration as tasks are completed, or mostly towards the end of the iteration? Are new tickets created as needed throughout the iteration?	|2|
|Did the team make realistic estimates of the effort required for the iteration (i.e. were all objectives achieved?) If not, did the team actively manage the project plan and identify low priority tasks to be removed from the iteration?|4|
|Does the project have a wiki page containing key details such as a summary of the project, the locations of issue trackers and SCM systems, and team member contact details and responsibilities?|4|
|Other/discretion||

### Comment
The issue tracking and branching system seems irregular at the moment. It was encouraged to open issues for each task, even if minor. Some merge requests had been open for more than a week which is not desirable for a project of such scale.

## Quality Assurance

| Question|Awarded<br>(1-5)|
|:--|--|
|Was every commit tested in a continuous integration environment by executing an automated regression test suite? |N/A|
|Do the team immediately fix any broken builds report by the CI environment, or are new features added despite broken builds?|N/A|
|Do the team perform code reviews? Has the team tried pair programming to actively review code?|1|
|Is the test suite effective (look for evidence from code coverage and/or mutation testing metrics)? Does the build/test cycle execute quickly (less than 10 minutes).	|N/A|
|Other/Discretion||

### Comments
It has been a handful of weeks since project allocation, and the team is still getting a grip on the technologies. The repository does not have adequate code yet, therefore pipeline and tests aren't expected to be set-up right now.

## Process Improvement

| Question|Awarded<br>(1-5)|
|:--|--|
|Has the team elicited and documented software process issues during a retrospective? Did all team members contribute to the retrospective?|5|
|Have software process problems been thoroughly analysed by the team, e.g. by using a -whys or other root cause analysis technique?	|4|
|Have the team identified process improvement actions? Have these been documented and assigned to a team member for monitoring/completion?	|4|
|Have results from previous software process improvement actions been evaluated and acted upon?	|2|
|Other/discretion||

### Comments
There was a lot of emphasis on Process Improvement over the previous sprint since the team had their project allocated, had a plan and also performed in their warmup PIA. The expectations were still not high at the moment since it is a learning curve, and there would be plenty of let-downs otherwise.
