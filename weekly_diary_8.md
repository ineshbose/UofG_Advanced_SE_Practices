## Diary Entry

<!-- Diary entries are marked on a pass/fail basis and are intended to help you build evidence for designing your PIA. If you make a reasonable attempt at the diary each week then you will receive the full mark for the diary. Use the diary to record your observations about the Level 3 Team Projects. Each diary entry should describe issues that you were asked to help with during the laboratory by your project team and the advice you gave to resolve the problem. Consider how the evidence from the diary entry might inform the design of your PIA, as well as any recommendations for changing the delivery of the course in light of the issue raised. -->

At this point, it seemed that the team had a more concrete discussion about their plans for the project where they would use a Django backend server, but the frontend would still be their JavaScript web browser that would send API requests. With this in mind, more details were discussed like REST Frameworks, API methods, client/server diagrams, deployment service, etc. Lot more discussion was faciliated between every team member going alphabetically so that everyone is engaged and speaks, talking about their thoughts over the week, and what will they be working on for the next week.

Along with that, for data gathering of the warmup PIA, another question was floated about how they felt that the activity helped them *so far*. It was also evident in their repository that they had been putting down issues with a template, assignee and MRs linked. While the team still thought the development was in early stages that didn't involve a lot of issue management, they know what to expect and handle, gaining confidence.
