## Diary Entry

<!-- Diary entries are marked on a pass/fail basis and are intended to help you build evidence for designing your PIA. If you make a reasonable attempt at the diary each week then you will receive the full mark for the diary. Use the diary to record your observations about the Level 3 Team Projects. Each diary entry should describe issues that you were asked to help with during the laboratory by your project team and the advice you gave to resolve the problem. Consider how the evidence from the diary entry might inform the design of your PIA, as well as any recommendations for changing the delivery of the course in light of the issue raised. -->

The team was on campus this week, and I planned to share the PIA I designed earlier in the day so that they would be able to work on it and finish it in a few hours on the same day, therefore I joined them around lunch time (~13:00). Everyone was in one row trying to research and work on something, and I hesitant to break their flow. To understand their approach, everyone had been assigned some part of the project like JavaScript/browser integration, packages/dependencies research, Python scripting and repository/wiki/wireframe managements.

As of their PIA, I shared the [designed repository](https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/2504266b/asep-warmup-pia-2021) and gave instructions on how to go about it. A few members had to go home, while a few remained and did not move from their seats until they had it complete. I was there with the team as well for a couple of hours in the event that they have questions or something goes wrong.

Since not all members were there by the end of it, and it was late, I planned to do the code review section of the PIA next week.
