## Diary Entry

<!-- Diary entries are marked on a pass/fail basis and are intended to help you build evidence for designing your PIA. If you make a reasonable attempt at the diary each week then you will receive the full mark for the diary. Use the diary to record your observations about the Level 3 Team Projects. Each diary entry should describe issues that you were asked to help with during the laboratory by your project team and the advice you gave to resolve the problem. Consider how the evidence from the diary entry might inform the design of your PIA, as well as any recommendations for changing the delivery of the course in light of the issue raised. -->

This meeting was online on Teams as the team decided to not go on campus this week. Despite that, now that the team knew what project they were allocated, I was hoping that they would've made good progress, also considering the conversation and ideas last week. However, it seemed like the team did not meet properly since. Aside from the lack of commits on the repository, I discussed progress in other areas, and there didn't seem to be much there either except from one member researching into dependencies/packages they can use.

I asked the team if they did any of the things I insisted that they do like assigning team roles (Toolsmith, UX Designer, etc) and those were not done either, so I had the team assign them during the meet on-spot. Hopefully there was more clarity for the team and next week should have better progress.
