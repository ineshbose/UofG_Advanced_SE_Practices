## Diary Entry

<!-- Diary entries are marked on a pass/fail basis and are intended to help you build evidence for designing your PIA. If you make a reasonable attempt at the diary each week then you will receive the full mark for the diary. Use the diary to record your observations about the Level 3 Team Projects. Each diary entry should describe issues that you were asked to help with during the laboratory by your project team and the advice you gave to resolve the problem. Consider how the evidence from the diary entry might inform the design of your PIA, as well as any recommendations for changing the delivery of the course in light of the issue raised. -->

Judging from the front-side of the team (not knowing what is going on in the background for the members) - through the repository and Teams chats, it seemed that the team was working, but not very effectively. With this concern, I used the meeting to confirm my speculations, and I was wrong. The team was making progress and had their project (a browser extension) already installed on their systems which I believe put them ahead of the game. There were also issues on the repository along with their Wiki that had personas and wireframes.

To dig deeper from this point in the meeting, I asked each member what they did during the week, and what they plan on doing for the next. Everyone had something reasonable, and if there wasn't anything for a member to work on for the next week, I asked the team manager to take a look into it.

Finally, as I kept emphasising on the importance of the remote repository state, I went over the condition of the repository which was in a decent state considering it's only the first few weeks, but since I'm particular about things, I pushed them beyond that. All my feedback were being noted in forms of issues (tasks to dos), for example removing non-related files (like a hello-world app tutorial, or files they used to test if they could commit) and configuring a `.gitignore` by referencing a template for frameworks and languages. I am very interested in seeing how the maintenance and state of the repository stays over time.
