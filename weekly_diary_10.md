## Diary Entry

<!-- Diary entries are marked on a pass/fail basis and are intended to help you build evidence for designing your PIA. If you make a reasonable attempt at the diary each week then you will receive the full mark for the diary. Use the diary to record your observations about the Level 3 Team Projects. Each diary entry should describe issues that you were asked to help with during the laboratory by your project team and the advice you gave to resolve the problem. Consider how the evidence from the diary entry might inform the design of your PIA, as well as any recommendations for changing the delivery of the course in light of the issue raised. -->

This week the repository activity was very impressive. There were many merge requests created and closed. The team had added issue templates and used `develop` branch (weirdly named `developer` - but the team is free to choose whatever suits them better for the development of their project). They shared their thoughts on viewing their previous customer meet's marks which did not contest against - areas of improvements were acknowledged.

As for the customer meet on the same week, the team was also very happy since they planned it better and had their presentation with them, therefore I did not have any hesitations or doubts. The team did a retrospective, and committed onto the week. The members also had plenty questions involving issue management, branching and practice preference, for example [how to automate issue closing](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#closing-issues-automatically) and [how to commit onto the right branch (`develop` or `master`)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20755434/what-is-the-master-branch-and-release-branch-for).

Since the next customer is on 19 January and it is December, the team's plans for this month were discussed. Next week, they wish to focus on their exams and I suggested to meet the week after before starting their Christmas break and then meeting in January. In the meantime, the team should start to put more of their mind in the project - although I don't expect this to be the accurate case for all members since the break will be for relaxation instead (can relate as a student).
