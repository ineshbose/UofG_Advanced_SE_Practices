## Diary Entry

<!-- Diary entries are marked on a pass/fail basis and are intended to help you build evidence for designing your PIA. If you make a reasonable attempt at the diary each week then you will receive the full mark for the diary. Use the diary to record your observations about the Level 3 Team Projects. Each diary entry should describe issues that you were asked to help with during the laboratory by your project team and the advice you gave to resolve the problem. Consider how the evidence from the diary entry might inform the design of your PIA, as well as any recommendations for changing the delivery of the course in light of the issue raised. -->

There were very good polishes over the week like adding a logo for their product, and still working on some issues. These issues were not distributed, but there were some tasks that everyone would work on. Further, some questions about deployment were answering - since they had issues deploying on a service like Heroku / PythonAnywhere that only provide a whitelist of sites for requests, so they could use their own server with either nginx or ngrok.
