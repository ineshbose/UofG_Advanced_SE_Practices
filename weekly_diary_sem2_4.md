## Diary Entry

<!-- Diary entries are marked on a pass/fail basis and are intended to help you build evidence for designing your PIA. If you make a reasonable attempt at the diary each week then you will receive the full mark for the diary. Use the diary to record your observations about the Level 3 Team Projects. Each diary entry should describe issues that you were asked to help with during the laboratory by your project team and the advice you gave to resolve the problem. Consider how the evidence from the diary entry might inform the design of your PIA, as well as any recommendations for changing the delivery of the course in light of the issue raised. -->

The final PIA was carried out and everyone did very well - the merge requests were starting to be opened much sooner than expected. Everyone seemed to get a lot more knowledge and practical idea about code reviews. More discussion followed about what they felt after/about the activity like wishing to use React, but also that their tasks were very similar and didn't have to put a lot of effort - but that would've been a tradeoff with the time to their project. Mainly, the team seems to be hopeful in setting up tests and further polishing their repository, and that would help my report through monitoring and evaluation.
