## Diary Entry

<!-- Diary entries are marked on a pass/fail basis and are intended to help you build evidence for designing your PIA. If you make a reasonable attempt at the diary each week then you will receive the full mark for the diary. Use the diary to record your observations about the Level 3 Team Projects. Each diary entry should describe issues that you were asked to help with during the laboratory by your project team and the advice you gave to resolve the problem. Consider how the evidence from the diary entry might inform the design of your PIA, as well as any recommendations for changing the delivery of the course in light of the issue raised. -->

The team had their first customer meeting on campus, and since the plan was to also help them go forward and discuss retrospective, the coach meeting had to be after their customer meet which ended at 16:00 afterwhich I joined the team in the lab, therefore meeting them in-person for the first time. It was very commendable to see all members together, including one member having to take multiple buses to get to Boyd Orr from Edinburgh.

Now that the team was aware of their allocation, they were able to plan out the strategy and requirements. During this discussion, I made the team aware of some "watch-outs" (like `stgit` going offline at times as it is a university instance, having team roles & meeting notes, and general VCS approach involving pipelines & branches). Even though I was the person speaking for most of the meeting, I didn't mind as the team was still just starting out. I'm hopeful that the team will have active participation and discussion from this point.

The final part about the meeting was their retrospective where they were able to quickly jot down items over the sprint that they felt "Went well", "Didn't go well" and "Could be improved", and get down to the bottom of every item. For example, one member felt that their meetings were of decent length, but not completely efficient and so each member started to share their thoughts on the same by rating the meeting efficiency out of 10 (0 being not efficient at all, 5 neutral / don't mind and 10 being absolutely efficient) where the scores were 4, 6, 7 and 7. This meant the team can really aim for a 10 if required. Since the team was tired after a whole long day in the lab and an hour was about to pass with nothing else left to discuss, we dismissed after deciding on a regular schedule for the coach meeting to be around the same time (16:30).
