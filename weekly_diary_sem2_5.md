## Diary Entry

<!-- Diary entries are marked on a pass/fail basis and are intended to help you build evidence for designing your PIA. If you make a reasonable attempt at the diary each week then you will receive the full mark for the diary. Use the diary to record your observations about the Level 3 Team Projects. Each diary entry should describe issues that you were asked to help with during the laboratory by your project team and the advice you gave to resolve the problem. Consider how the evidence from the diary entry might inform the design of your PIA, as well as any recommendations for changing the delivery of the course in light of the issue raised. -->

This meeting was to make sure that the team would be prepared to meet the customer for their last meeting until the final presentation. Along with this, changes in their practices after the PIA were discussed and unfortunately, there did not seem to be much which was disappointing. A further push has been given to the team, and hopefully there would be some improvements over the couple of weeks, given that their product is also at a good state, allowing them to focus more on the development/polishing side.
