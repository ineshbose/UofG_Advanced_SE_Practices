## Diary Entry

<!-- Diary entries are marked on a pass/fail basis and are intended to help you build evidence for designing your PIA. If you make a reasonable attempt at the diary each week then you will receive the full mark for the diary. Use the diary to record your observations about the Level 3 Team Projects. Each diary entry should describe issues that you were asked to help with during the laboratory by your project team and the advice you gave to resolve the problem. Consider how the evidence from the diary entry might inform the design of your PIA, as well as any recommendations for changing the delivery of the course in light of the issue raised. -->

The team's progress seemed to be going steady, and there wasn't much to discuss other than plans for 1) the next customer meeting and 2) the final PIA. It seemed that the team had their product, but also needed to fulfill some requirements from the Team Project course. At this point, I was planning for the final PIA to be based on code reviews, but as a measure, I inquired the team if they have an outcome in mind for the activity to which they said that they would like to learn about testing. This gave me an idea about making the activity about writing tests, but then doing code reviews about the merge requests. This would have to be planned more.
