## Diary Entry

<!-- Diary entries are marked on a pass/fail basis and are intended to help you build evidence for designing your PIA.  If you make a reasonable attempt at the diary each week then you will receive the full mark for the diary. Use the diary to record your observations about the Level 3 Team Projects. Each diary entry should describe issues that you were asked to help with during the laboratory by your project team and the advice you gave to resolve the problem.  Consider how the evidence from the diary entry might inform the design of your PIA, as well as any recommendations for changing the delivery of the course in light of the issue raised. -->

The team responded promptly on short notice when the meeting had to be scheduled the same day. As this was the first meeting with the coach, I started off with an introduction where I talked about my role as a coach (and not a manager), my previous experiences, my studies & area of interest, while hoping that the students would also engage and introduce themselves with interest and engagement (for example I started with my camera on, but no one else had them on). So for a little icebreaker, I asked the students to introduce themselves by pronouncing their names so that I don't get it wrong, share their music taste if they like, what they worked on for WAD2, and why they're studying Computing Science (eg strand of interest).

From there, we went to discuss what stage they're at. Judging from that, and the chat history on Teams, it seemed that everyone was aware of the responsibility, however the effective teamwork and coordination is not there yet. The discussion was over bidding of the projects, and the team had already trimmed down and made notes about each project. For the final ranking, I recommended using an Excel sheet where everyone could rank the projects 1 to 28 in their own columns, and then a final column would total that.

The call went on for half an hour and I proposed the same time for the weekly coach meetings, however the students weren't exactly sure of their schedule, so the meeting schedule is tentative at the moment with hope to fix it by next week. I made sure to remind them about the bidding due date and they can ping me without hesitation for questions.
