# UofG Advanced Software Engineering Practices

This repository contains all reports, diaries and assessments (in markdown) for ASEP (H) Coursework.

## Submission Instructions

1. Fork the repository from [the provided link](https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/asep/asep-coursework-2021). Do **not** clone it directly as changes will not be able to be pushed to the template repository.
2. Name the repository `ASEP Coursework 2021` and give it the path `asep-coursework-2021`. The complete URL for user 1234567a should therefore be `https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/1234567a/asep-coursework-2021.
3. Make copies of `FormativeAssessment1` for sprints 2, 3, 4, and 5.
4. Make copies of `weekly_diary_2.md` for weeks 2-11.
5. Make copies of `report.md` called `warmup.md` and `final.md` respectively.
6. Add other files as required, such as images for inclusion in reports, but do not make changes to this minimal structure of the repository so that all the submissions can be discovered.
7. Report templates are in markdown format, like this document. To complete the reports, replace the content between the XML comments `<!-- -->` with own material.  Do **not** modify the structure of the assessment and feedback tables.
8. Make sure that the changes are pushed to the repository in `master` before the submission deadline for each element of coursework.
