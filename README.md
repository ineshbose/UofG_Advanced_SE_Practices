# Submission Instructions

1. Fork this repository to your personal namespace, do **not** clone it directly as you will not be able to push changes to the template repository.
2. Call the repository `ASEP Coursework 2021` and give it the path `asep-coursework-2021`.  The complete URL for user 1234567a should therefore be `https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/1234567a/asep-coursework-2021.
3. You will need to make copies of `FormativeAssessment1` for sprints 2, 3, 4, and 5.
4. You will need to make copies of `weekly_diary_2.md` for weeks 2-11.
5. You will need to make copies of `report.md` called `warmup.md` and `final.md` respectively.
6. You may add other files as you wish, such as images for inclusion in reports, but do not make changes to this minimal structure of the repository so that all your submissions can be discovered.
7. Report templates are in markdown format, like this document. To complete your reports replace the content between the XML comments `<!-- -->` with your own material.  Do **not** modify the structure of the assessment and feedback tables.
8. Make sure that you push your changes to your repository in `master` before the submission deadline for each element of coursework.
